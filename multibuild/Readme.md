# What inside this folder

This folder saves different qpm manifest that can be used for multiple game version.

The `target.cmake` is included in `CMakeLists.txt` and for code compat.

The main idea is release multiple `.qmod` with the same source code, to make sure the old version of game can receive the latest update for the mod.
